# exercises
This repo has all my solutions for exercises of the book Python Programming Exercises, gently explained, by Al Sweigart.

This exercises are easy, but are the type of problems that appears in simple projects.

I intend to do some (or all) the projects of other book of the same author: The Big Book of Small Projects.
